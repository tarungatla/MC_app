# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the application to improve user experience and reduce resource usage.

## Image Optimization

### Lazy Loading and Caching

- Implemented `expo-image` for efficient image loading with built-in caching
- Added memory and disk caching for images with `cachePolicy="memory-disk"`
- Implemented placeholder images during loading
- Added transition effects for smoother image loading

### Component Optimization

- Memoized the `PropertyCard` component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added `numberOfLines` to text components to prevent layout shifts
- Optimized image dimensions to reduce memory usage

## Data Fetching and Caching

### Custom Data Fetching Hook

- Created a reusable `useDataFetching` hook that implements:
  - Pagination with lazy loading
  - Local caching with AsyncStorage
  - Cache expiration management
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms

### API Request Optimization

- Implemented query parameters for filtering and pagination
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Optimized network requests by only fetching necessary data

## UI Performance

### List Rendering Optimization

- Implemented `FlatList` with performance optimizations:
  - `maxToRenderPerBatch` to limit the number of items rendered in each batch
  - `windowSize` to control the render window size
  - `removeClippedSubviews` to detach off-screen views on Android
  - `initialNumToRender` to limit initial render batch
  - `onEndReachedThreshold` for better infinite scrolling

### Search and Filter Optimization

- Implemented debouncing for search input to prevent excessive filtering
- Added throttling for category selection to prevent excessive API calls
- Used local state for immediate UI feedback while debouncing actual filtering

## Background Processing

### Task Management

- Created a `BackgroundTaskManager` for handling non-UI tasks
- Implemented task queuing to prevent UI blocking
- Added utilities for background processing:
  - `runInBackground` for executing tasks without blocking the UI
  - `executeWithDelay` for delayed execution
  - `debounce` for limiting function call frequency
  - `throttle` for rate-limiting function calls

## Memory Management

- Implemented proper cleanup in components
- Used memoization to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Optimized state management to reduce re-renders

## Future Optimizations

- Implement virtualized lists for very large datasets
- Add image compression and resizing on the server
- Implement progressive loading for images
- Add offline support with local database
- Implement code splitting for larger applications
